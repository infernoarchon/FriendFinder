# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a node and express app that asks users several questions, and then matches them with another user based on their responses.

## Backlog
- Add validation logic to survey forms
- Find way to preserve JSON data

## Additional Notes
- Since this app is deployed on a free Heroku dyno, it will periodically reset the `/api/friends` JSON
